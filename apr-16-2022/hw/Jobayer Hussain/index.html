  <h2><i>Philosophy</i></h2>  <hr>
    <p>Historically, philosophy encompassed all bodies of knowledge and a practitioner was known as a philosopher. From the time of <b><i>Ancient Greek</i></b> philosopher Aristotle to the 19th century, "natural philosophy" encompassed <b><u>astronomy, medicine, and physics.</u></b> For example, <a href="">Newton's</a> 1687 Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy later became classified as a book of physics. In the 19th century, the growth of modern research universities led academic philosophy and other disciplines to professionalize and specialize. Since then, various areas of investigation that were traditionally part of philosophy have become separate academic disciplines, and namely the social sciences such as <b><u><i>psychology, sociology, linguistics, and economics.</i></u></b> 
        <br><br>Today, major subfields of academic philosophy include <a href="">metaphysics</a>, which is concerned with the fundamental nature of <b><i>existence and reality;</i></b> epistemology, which studies the nature of knowledge and belief; ethics, which is concerned with <b>moral value; and logic</b>, which studies the rules of inference that allow one to derive conclusions from true premises.Other notable subfields include <u>philosophy of religion, philosophy of science, political philosophy, aesthetics, philosophy of language, and philosophy of mind.</u></p>

  <h3>Western Philosophy</h3>
  <p><i>Western philosophy is the philosophical tradition of the Western world, dating back to pre-Socratic thinkers who were active in 6th-century Greece (BCE), such as Thales (c. 624 – c. 545 BCE) and Pythagoras (c. 570 – c. 495 BCE) who practiced a 'love of wisdom' (Latin: philosophia)[46] and were also termed 'students of nature' (physiologoi).</i></p>

  <p>Western philosophy can be divided into three eras:</p>

  <ul>
  <ol><b>Ancient</b> (Greco-Roman).</ol>
  <ol><b>Medieval philosophy</b> (referring to Christian European thought).</ol>
  <ol><b>Modern philosophy</b> (beginning in the 17th century).</ol>
  </ul>

  <h4>Ancient era</h4>
  <p><i>While our knowledge of the ancient era begins with Thales in the 6th century BCE, little is known about the philosophers who came before Socrates (commonly known as the pre-Socratics). The ancient era was dominated by Greek philosophical schools. Most notable among the schools influenced by Socrates' teachings were Plato, who founded the Platonic Academy, and his student Aristotle,[47] who founded the Peripatetic school. Other ancient philosophical traditions influenced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates" target="_blank">Socrates</a> included <u>Cynicism, Cyrenaicism, Stoicism, and Academic Skepticism.</u> Two other traditions were influenced by Socrates' contemporary, Democritus: Pyrrhonism and Epicureanism. Important topics covered by the Greeks included metaphysics (with competing theories such as atomism and monism), cosmology, the nature of the well-lived life (eudaimonia), the possibility of knowledge, and the nature of reason (logos). With the rise of the <b>Roman empire</b>, Greek philosophy was increasingly discussed in Latin by Romans such as Cicero and Seneca (see Roman philosophy).</i></p>

  <h4>Medieval era</h4>
  <p><i>Medieval philosophy <u>(5th–16th centuries)</u> took place during the period following the fall of the Western Roman Empire and was dominated by the rise of Christianity; it hence reflects Judeo-Christian theological concerns while also retaining a continuity with Greco-Roman thought. Problems such as the existence and nature of God, the nature of faith and reason, metaphysics, and the problem of evil were discussed in this period. Some key medieval thinkers include <u>St. Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Boethius, Anselm and Roger Bacon.</u> Philosophy for these thinkers was viewed as an aid to theology (ancilla theologiae), and hence they sought to align their philosophy with their interpretation of sacred scripture. This period saw the development of scholasticism, a text critical method developed in medieval universities based on close reading and disputation on key texts. The Renaissance period saw increasing focus on classic Greco-Roman thought and on a robust humanism.</i></p>

  <h4>Modern era</h4>
  <p><i>Early modern philosophy in the Western world begins with thinkers such as <b>Thomas Hobbes and René Descartes</b> <u>(1596–1650)</u>.[48] Following the rise of natural science, modern philosophy was concerned with developing a secular and rational foundation for knowledge and moved away from traditional structures of authority such as religion, scholastic thought and the Church. Major modern philosophers include <u>Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and Kant</u>.

    19th-century philosophy (sometimes called late modern philosophy) was influenced by the wider 18th-century movement termed "the Enlightenment", and includes figures such as Hegel, a key figure in German idealism; Kierkegaard, who developed the foundations for existentialism; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche" target="_blank"> Nietzsche</a>, a famed anti-Christian; John Stuart Mill, who promoted utilitarianism; Karl Marx, who developed the foundations for communism; and the American William James. The 20th century saw the split between analytic philosophy and continental philosophy, as well as philosophical trends such as phenomenology, existentialism, logical positivism, pragmatism and the linguistic turn (see Contemporary philosophy).</i></p>
